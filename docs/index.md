# Image Coding for Machines via Feature-Preserving Rate-Distortion Optimization

Welcome to the TMM_CfM project documentation! This project explores the application of the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) in the context of coding for machines.

## About the Project

This repository contains the implementation and research materials for our TMM paper on coding for machines. The Transfer Matrix Method is a powerful mathematical technique that can be applied to various engineering and computational problems.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Computation**: Utilizes the Transfer Matrix Method for optimized calculations
- **Machine-Readable Code**: Designed with machine learning and automated processing in mind
- **Research-Backed**: Based on rigorous mathematical foundations
- **Open Source**: Fully accessible for research and educational purposes

## Getting Started

To get started with TMM_CfM, check out our interactive Colab notebooks:

### Interactive Notebooks

1. **[Introduction to TMM_CfM](../notebooks/01_introduction.ipynb)** - Learn the basics of our implementation
2. **[Usage Examples](../notebooks/02_usage_examples.ipynb)** - See practical examples of TMM applications

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
