## How to Use

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
Click on the "Open in Colab" badge in any notebook to run it directly in Google Colab. No installation required!

### Option 2: Local Jupyter
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sf219/TMM_CfM.git
   cd TMM_CfM/notebooks
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Option 3: JupyterLab
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of linear algebra (matrices, vectors)
- Familiarity with NumPy is helpful but not required

## Dependencies

The notebooks require the following Python packages:
- `numpy` - Numerical computations
- `scipy` - Scientific computing
- `matplotlib` - Plotting and visualization
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning utilities (for advanced examples)

All dependencies can be installed via:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
